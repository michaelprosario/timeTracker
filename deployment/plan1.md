- As an engineer, I would like to deploy the time tracker application to microsoft azure using bicept templates
    - We want this deployment code to serve as an example for the deployment stamps pattern
    - Key secrets should be stored in azure key vault
    - The time tracker application should be deployed to an app service
    - The database should be deployed to a managed postgres instances
    - The time sheet application image can be deployed to public docker hub
    - The azure app service should pull secrets from the azure keyvault
    - Write documentation to explain each step.

- Think about this problem.
- Document a refined plan in plan2.md
